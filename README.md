# Multimodal mutational signatures (SBS+ID)
This repository contains the code for extracting multimodal mutational signatures (SBS + ID) as described in the method introduced in *"Joint inference of mutational signatures from indels and single-nucleotide substitutions reveals prognostic impact of DNA repair deficiencies in tumors"* by Patricia Ferrer-Torres, Iván Galván-Femenía, and Fran Supek. This study presents a multimodal method that jointly analyzes SBS and indel mutations to improve the accuracy of mutational signature extraction. We identified clinically relevant subtypes of the HR-deficiency signature SBS3 and predicted patient survival more effectively than existing approaches.
